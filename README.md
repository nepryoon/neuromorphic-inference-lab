# neuromorphic-inference-lab
Neuromorphic Inference Lab is a long-term research initiative exploring how brain-inspired architectures and spiking neural networks can support autonomous agents that reason under uncertainty. The project focuses on neuromorphic hardware, probabilistic and active-inference–based algorithms, and methods for using neuromorphic processors as first-class computational substrates for learning, prediction and decision-making in real-world scenarios.
